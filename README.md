## SIP Web Application

SIP, or Spirit Index Program, is a web application that utilizes TheCocktailDB API and Yelp Fusion API to search for cocktails using a base liquor (vodka, rum, gin, whisky, etc.) as well as searching for local bars that serve cocktails if you don't feel like making a cocktail at home!

The landing page is the cocktail search page. Using a dropdown to select the base liquor, results are loaded from TheCocktailDB API and displayed with the cocktail name and a picture of the cocktail. When you click on a cocktail, a modal appears containing the cocktail ingredients and mixing instructions. There is also an option to save a selected cocktail to your local storage to access again later.

A link to a "cocktail locator" page will bring you to a similar page, but with an input for a zipcode so that users can enter their zipcode and search for bars in the area utilizing the Yelp API. This page brings up a list of results including the name of the bar and its address
